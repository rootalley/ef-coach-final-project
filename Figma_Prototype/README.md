## 1. Introduction
EFS —time management, organization, planning, etc.— are essential for academic success, especially college students with increased responsibility for self-directed learning. Students with diverse learning needs often struggle to develop their EFS. Gaps in executive abilities can go unnoticed in K-12 education with one study estimating that only 20% of adults with ADHD were diagnosed in K-12 (Newcorn, et al, 2007). The heightened demand for self-regulated learning present in higher education learning environments tends to expose these challenges (Desmedt, 2004; Drion, 2018; Zimmerman, 2001). Therefore, an EFS support system could have widespread benefits. 

Current LMS platforms, such Canvas, lack personalized learning tools. Recent research suggests that the LMS could be improved to better support self-regulated learning (SRL) by incorporating strategies such as chunking and micro-learning (Shine & Heath, 2020). These approaches help break down complex tasks into manageable steps, offer timely feedback, and provide structured pathways to keep learners on track. This shortcoming in LMS functionality can negatively impact academic performance, increase dropout rates, and exacerbate educational inequities, particularly for neurodivergent students. Therefore, there is a critical need to integrate more effective SRL strategies within LMS environments. 

The proposed solution was to design and build an online system that supports the assessment and development of EFS, enhancing self-regulation and improving student academic outcomes. Students using this tool would complete an EFS self-assessment to identify areas of strength and weakness. Using the results, the system would deliver coaching through evidence-based activities such as prioritization or goal setting (Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2014). For accessibility, the tool would integrate with existing LMS platforms (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle), offering features to prioritize tasks, chunk assignments, and other personalized strategies.
